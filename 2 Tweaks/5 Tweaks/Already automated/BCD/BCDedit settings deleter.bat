:: Made by CatGamer on stream (twitch.tv/catgamerop) go follow <3
:: This is Melody's bcdedit tweaks teardown
:: Made in order to educate myself and others, who will check this bat file
:: Hopefully my viewers (Plyra) and I helped figure out what those bcdedits do
:: Some commands are meme and / or set by default in windows (like configaccesspolicy)
:: Some of those I commented, but u can use them if u want
:: If you want to improve this, message me or add some changes urself to this.
:: NO COPYPASTERINO OR PANOS WILL FRY & EAT UR DUCK (https://clips.twitch.tv/GeniusKindLocustSoBayed)

bcdedit /timeout 7
:: time to display boot options
:: set this to 0 if you have only 1 OS
:: thanks to whyskii

bcdedit /deletevalue allowedinmemorysettings
:: no settings saved in memory (didn't find desc on the internet)

bcdedit /deletevalue useplatformclock

:: test, tscsyncpolicy legacy might be better for you :)
:: Controls the times stamp counter synchronization policy

bcdedit /deletevalue debug
:: Disables kernel debugger

:: bcdedit /deletevalue isolatedcontext
:: This setting is used to differentiate between the Windows 7 and Windows 8 implementations of UEFI. The element data format is BcdBooleanElement.
:: Do not modify this setting. If this setting is removed from a Windows 8 installation, it will not boot. If this setting is added to a Windows 7 installation, it will not boot.
:: This value is supported starting in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012.

bcdedit /deletevalue pae
:: When PAE is enabled, the system loads the PAE version of the Windows kernel
:: It defines a page table hierarchy of three levels (instead of two), with table entries of 64 bits each instead of 32, allowing these CPUs to directly access a physical address space larger than 4 gigabytes (232 bytes).

bcdedit /deletevalue bootmenupolicy
:: When Legacy is selected, the Advanced options menu (F8) is available

bcdedit /deletevalue usefirmwarepcisettings
:: Enables or disables the use of BIOS-configured peripheral component interconnect (PCI) resources

:: Don't think it is that necessary

bcdedit /deletevalue Yes
:: Controls the display of a high-resolution bitmap in place of the Windows boot screen display and animation

bcdedit /deletevalue x2apicpolicy
:: Enables or disables the use of extended APIC mode

bcdedit /deletevalue vsmlaunchtype

:: bcdedit /set usephysicaldestination No
:: Forces the use of the APIC in physical destination mode

bcdedit /deletevalue ems
:: Emergency Management Services (EMS) provides an RS-232 accessible serial console interface to the bootloader menu on modern versions of Microsoft Windows
:: EMS allows users to control particular components of a server remotely, even when the server is not connected to the network or to other standard remote-administration tools

:: bcdedit /deletevalue firstmegabytepolicy UseAll
:: Indicates how the first megabyte of memory is to be used
:: FirstMegabytePolicyUseNone (0) Use none of the first megabyte of memory.
:: FirstMegabytePolicyUseAll (1) Use all of the first megabyte of memory.
:: FirstMegabytePolicyUsePrivate (2) Reserved for future use.

:: This is already defaulted
:: bcdedit /set configaccesspolicy Default 
:: Indicates the access policy for PCI configuration space. The element data format is BcdIntegerElement. The following are the possible values.
:: ConfigAccessPolicyDefault (0)
:: Access to PCI configuration space through the memory-mapped region is allowed.
:: ConfigAccessPolicyDisallowMmConfig (1)
:: Access to PCI configuration space through the memory-mapped region is not allowed. 
:: This setting is used for platforms that implement memory-mapped configuration space incorrectly. 
:: The CFC/CF8 access mechanism can be used to access configuration space on these platforms.

:: Device if u want to use it (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_5-level_paging) 
:: bcdedit /set linearaddress57 optin
:: Intel 5-level paging
:: It extends the size of virtual addresses from 48 bits to 57 bits, increasing the addressable virtual memory from 256 TiB to 128 PiB.

:: This should be already default in OS (source windows documentation https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/bcdedit--dbgsettings)
:: bcdedit /set noumex Yes 
:: Specifies that the kernel debugger ignores user-mode exceptions. 
:: By default, the kernel debugger breaks for certain user-mode exceptions, such as STATUS_BREAKPOINT and STATUS_SINGLE_STEP. 
:: The /noumex parameter is effective only when there is no user-mode debugger attached to the process.

bcdedit /deletevalue bootems 
:: Emergency Management Services (EMS) provides an RS-232 accessible serial console interface to the bootloader menu on modern versions of Microsoft Windows
:: EMS allows users to control particular components of a server remotely, even when the server is not connected to the network or to other standard remote-administration tools

:: Why would u ever need to use this? LOOOOL (Defaulted in windows) 
:: bcdedit /set graphicsmodedisabled No
:: Indicates whether graphics mode is disabled and boot applications must use text mode display

:: Same as above || bcdedit /set highestmode Yes
:: Forces highest available graphics resolution at boot. This value can only be used on UEFI systems.
:: This value is supported starting in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012

bcdedit /deletevalue extendedinput
:: Enables boot applications to leverage BIOS support for extended console input.

bcdedit /deletevalue forcefipscrypto
:: Force the use of FIPS cryptography checks on boot applications
:: This value is supported starting in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012

bcdedit /deletevalue perfmem 
:: Size of the buffer to allocate for performance data logging. 
:: This option acts similarly to the removememory element, since it prevents Windows from seeing the size specified as available memory.

:: Dunno if u should use this too 
:: bcdedit /set clustermodeaddressing 1 
:: Defines the maximum number of processors to include in a single Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC) cluster.

bcdedit /deletevalue configflags
:: Specifies processor-specific configuration flags.

:: useless if u set x2apic to on
:: bcdedit /set uselegacyapicmode No
:: Forces usage of basic APIC functionality even though the chipset reports extended APIC functionality as present. Used in cases of hardware errata and/or incompatibility.

:: also useless like really LOOOOOOL
:: bcdedit /set onecpu No 
:: Causes Windows to use only one CPU on a multiprocessor system

bcdedit /deletevalue halbreakpoint 
:: Causes the HAL to stop at a breakpoint early in HAL initialization. 
:: The first thing the Windows kernel does when it initializes is to initialize the HAL, so this breakpoint is the earliest one possible (unless boot debugging is used). 
:: If the switch is used without the /DEBUG switch, the system will elicit a blue screen with a STOP code of 0x00000078 (PHASE0_ EXCEPTION).

:: Also seems useless
:: bcdedit /set forcelegacyplatform No 
:: Forces the OS to assume the presence of legacy PC devices like CMOS and keyboard controllers

:: !!! NEW !!!

bcdedit /deletevalue integrityservices
:: Enables or disables code integrity services, which are used by Kernel Mode Code Signing. Default is Enabled.
:: If I get it right, there will be no need to type nointegritychecks if this is set. Disabling services is better than just not letting them run.

:: Thought it might be better for someone 
:: bcdedit /set traditionalksegmappings no
:: Determines whether the kernel will honor the traditional KSEG0 mapping that was originally required for MIPS support. 
:: With KSEG0 mappings, the bottom 24 bits of the kernel’s initial virtual address space will map to the same physical address (that is, 0x80800000 virtual is 0x800000 in RAM).
:: !!! Disabling this requirement allows more low memory to be available, which can help with some hardware.


bcdedit /deletevalue bootux
:: Defines the boot graphics user experience that the user will see. Disabled means that no graphics will be seen during boot time (only a black screen)


bcdedit /deletevalue hypervisorlaunchtype
:: Enables loading of the hypervisor on a Hyper-V system, or forces it to be disabled.


bcdedit /deletevalue nx
:: bcdedit /set nx Optin
:: ^ Needed for Valorant anti-cheat (credits to Vincentino)
:: Disables Data Execution Prevention || is a security feature, DEP is intended to prevent an application or service from executing code from a non-executable memory region
:: In short, DEP perform additional checks on memory to prevent malicious code or exploits from running on the system by shut down the process once detected


bcdedit /deletevalue usefirmwarepcisettings
:: Stops Windows from dynamically assigning IO/IRQ resources to PCI devices and leaves the devices configured by the BIOS

bcdedit /deletevalue tpmbootentropy
:: Forces a specific TPM Boot Entropy policy to be selected by the boot loader and passed on to the kernel. 
:: TPM Boot Entropy, when used, seeds the kernel’s random number generator (RNG) with data obtained from the TPM (if present)
:: Basically disabled a security feature (source - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module)
