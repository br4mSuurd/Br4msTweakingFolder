Thanks for downloading Valorant FPS Boost Pack by fragval <3
These files are registry files and won't hurt your computer, you can create a restore point to make sure that everything is gonna be okay.

How to use fragval's FPS Boost Pack:
Simply just merge/click every regedit file you see in PC Optimisation.
Secondly, then select your RAM in RAM Optimisation. (I personally use 32GB of RAM) 
Thirdly, in the last part choose Valorant Priority to high.
Lastly, open TimerResolution and press Maximum. DON'T press X/close the program, just press -/minimize it and run it in the background while playing Valorant. 
This program helps in any game not only Valorant and it's gonna make your game feel about 0,5 reduced input lag,
in my opinion it's not noticable but it can help you clutch because of that small diff that TimerResolution gives you.

If you have any problem feel free to DM me.
