## This GitHub project is designed to optimize your computer for gaming, specifically for the game Valorant. The project contains various folders with different types of optimizations to improve your gaming experience by reducing latency and improving FPS.

### Project Description
The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive set of optimizations for your computer to run games better. While the optimizations are primarily focused on Valorant, they can be applied to other games as well.

The project contains several folders, each with its own set of optimizations. The folders include:

#### Disclamer
I didnt create these optimizations by myself. in the last 2 years ive tried countless optimizations and put them together in this pack. my goal for this project is to prodide you with the best tweaks, to optimize your performance and get the most out of your computers performance.

PC Optimization
RAM
GPU
Game-Specific Optimizations
General Tweaks
Miscellaneous Tweaks
Folder Structure

#### Usage
To use this project, simply download the release and navigate to the desired folder. Each folder contains a README file with instructions on how to apply the optimizations. You can apply all the optimizations in each folder or pick and choose the ones that you want to use.

It's important to note that some optimizations may not work for everyone, and some may have unintended consequences. Please use caution when applying these optimizations and backup your system before making any changes.

#### Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome. If you have an optimization that you would like to add, please open a pull request with a detailed description of the optimization and how it improves gaming performance.
